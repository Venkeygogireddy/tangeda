    <h2>Welcome to Tangeda</h2>
    <p>
      Tangeda is a village rich in culture, tradition, and natural beauty.
      Nestled along the river, it has grown from a historic settlement into
      a vibrant community that still honours its roots and legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village is closely associated with the legacy of
      <strong>The King Anumula Machireddy Garu</strong>, whose influence
      and stories are still remembered with pride by the people of Tangeda.
      Over generations, families have preserved customs, festivals, and
      values that keep the spirit of the village alive.
